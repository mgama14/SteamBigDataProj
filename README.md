This project dives into Steam review data to figure out what influences whether reviews are positive or negative. Using a decision tree model, features like playtime, the number of games owned, and the time of day reviews were written were analyzed to predict review sentiment. Newly engineered features like recency_bias (time between last played and review) and time_of_day added extra layers of insight into player behavior. The model ended up with a cross-validated accuracy of 85.61%, showing it did a solid job overall. Along the way, patterns in review behavior and player engagement were uncovered, tying it all back to what shapes sentiment in gaming reviews.
